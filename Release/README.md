## EnemyItemDisplays
- Adds item displays to monsters for use in the Void Fields or with the Evolution artifact (or if you just enjoy playing as monsters for some reason
- Only a few monsters are done and monsters don't have all items, just ones that synergize with them or look cool on them

ping me in the modding discord for any bugs/suggestions- @thetimesweeper#5727

Feel free to contribute to the repo, linked above. If you'd like to and don't know how, absolutely ping me so I can show you.

Coming Soon, clear instructions and further setting up the repo so anyone can contribute item displays. There's many thousands of them to do, so this is an impossible task without a great community cooperation.
